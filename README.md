# GifTastic
First assignment working with API's. 

This assignment is making an AJAX call to GIPHY.com's database of gifs.
When a user clicks on any of the available buttons, a series of 10 gifs related to that button will appear on that page. However, they will be still. 

The user has to click the gif in order for it to play. If they want it to stop, they can click on it again.

If the user wants more options other than the buttons provided, they can add one on their own by use the input box on right side to do so. This will create a new button, and then the user can click this button and generate 10 new gifs just like before.
